# Gradient Generator
This is a simple gradient generator web application built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Users can select two colors and choose from eight different directions for the gradient. As soon as the user makes any changes, the application updates both the background of the webpage and the result area, which also provides the corresponding code for the userâ€™s selected gradient.

Additionally, when the user clicks the result area, the generated code is automatically copied to the clipboard for easy use.
